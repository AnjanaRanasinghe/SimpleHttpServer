# Simple HTTP Server

## Overview

This project implements a basic HTTP server in Java, developed as part of a mock exercise for network programming. 
The SimpleHttpServer class creates a lightweight server that listens for HTTP requests on port 8080 and handles GET and POST requests to the /myendpoint path. The server responds with appropriate status codes and messages based on the request method and path.
